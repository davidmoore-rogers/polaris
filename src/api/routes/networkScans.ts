/**
 * src/api/routes/networkScans.ts — saved network **Discovery** CRUD + runs.
 *
 * Mounted at /api/v1/network-scans behind a `networkScan:read` FLOOR on the
 * whole router, with per-route escalation above it. The floor is the `/map`
 * mount precedent: three of its read routes were auth-only until 2026-08, so
 * any session or token could enumerate every FortiGate's coordinates and
 * topology regardless of role. A Discovery's targets and results are the same
 * kind of recon material.
 *
 *   GET    /                    networkScan:read    (own + public, each one's newest run)
 *   POST   /preview-targets     networkScan:read    (pure IP math, no packets)
 *   GET    /runs/:runId         networkScan:read    (progress + hits)
 *   GET    /:id                 networkScan:read
 *   POST   /                    networkScan:write
 *   PUT    /:id                 networkScan:write   (own; else fullwrite)
 *   DELETE /:id                 networkScan:write   (own; else fullwrite)
 *   POST   /:id/run             networkScan:write   (202 + the run; any VISIBLE one)
 *   POST   /runs/:runId/cancel  networkScan:write
 *   POST   /runs/:runId/adopt   networkScan:write + assets:write  (CHAINED)
 *
 * `/preview-targets` and `/runs/...` are declared BEFORE "/:id" so the literal
 * paths aren't captured as ids (the deliveryChannels `/web-push` precedent).
 *
 * **The chained gate on adopt is the point of the whole permission design**
 * (business rule 34a): running a Discovery creates nothing, so a role may be
 * allowed to find out what is on a range without being allowed to put it into
 * inventory. `integrations:write`-style blanket gates are exactly what that
 * separation would lose.
 *
 * `/preview-targets` is read-level deliberately: it resolves typed targets with
 * the pure `expandScanTargets` plus one indexed read, touches no network, and
 * gating it at write would block the wizard's target preview for a role that is
 * allowed to look at Discoveries.
 *
 * **Visibility (the SavedDashboard / SavedTableFilter model).** A Discovery is
 * `private` (its owner alone) or `public` (every caller holding
 * `networkScan:read`), which is what lets one operator build a sweep another
 * one runs. Three consequences here:
 *
 *   - every route resolves the caller's user id and hands it to the service,
 *     which scopes the read; an invisible row answers **404, not 403** — a
 *     private Discovery's existence is not other operators' business;
 *   - RUNNING is gated on visibility, not ownership. Publishing one exists
 *     precisely so somebody else can run it;
 *   - EDIT and DELETE are the owner's, with `networkScan:fullwrite` as the
 *     housekeeping override for someone else's row (including an orphan left
 *     by a deleted account). That check lives here rather than in the service
 *     because it needs the caller's permission level.
 *
 * PUBLISHING deliberately requires nothing beyond the `write` every mutation
 * here already needs — unlike saved filters and dashboards, whose mounts sit at
 * `read` and use `write` to mark the publish. `networkadmin` and `assetsadmin`
 * hold `write`, not `fullwrite`, and they are exactly the roles that author
 * Discoveries; requiring more would put sharing out of reach of everyone it is
 * for.

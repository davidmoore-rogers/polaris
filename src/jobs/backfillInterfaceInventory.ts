/**
 * src/jobs/backfillInterfaceInventory.ts
 *
 * One-shot startup job: seed the CURRENT-STATE interface inventory
 * (`asset_interfaces`) from each asset's most recent full system-info snapshot
 * in `asset_interface_samples`.
 *
 * WHY IT'S NEEDED. `persistInterfaces` populates an asset the next time its
 * full system-info pass runs — but that cadence is `pollInterval`-linked and
 * can be as long as 24 hours. Without a backfill, an install that upgrades
 * would have assets whose System tab, topology edges and auto-monitor pin
 * picker read an empty table for up to a day once those readers cut over. The
 * data to avoid that is already on disk; this just copies it across.
 *
 * SAFE TO SKIP DATA. Only assets with a `lastSystemInfoAt` anchor are
 * considered, and only rows at exactly that timestamp — the same equality match
 * the System tab used before the cutover, so the seeded set is precisely what
 * the UI was already rendering. An asset with no anchor (never scraped) simply
 * waits for its first pass, which is correct.
 *
 * CREATE-ONLY. Assets that already have inventory rows are skipped rather than
 * overwritten: by the time this runs a live scrape may already have written
 * fresher state, and a stale snapshot must never clobber it. That also makes
 * the job idempotent independent of its marker.
 *
 * Import this from src/app.ts to activate.

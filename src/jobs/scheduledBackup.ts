/**
 * src/jobs/scheduledBackup.ts
 *
 * Periodic scheduler: takes an automatic database backup on the operator's
 * cadence, prunes old scheduled copies to the retention count, and optionally
 * copies each finished backup to an off-host directory.
 *
 * Default-OFF (`backupSchedule.enabled === false`), so an upgrade never starts
 * writing gigabytes unasked and never competes with an enterprise backup product
 * that may already cover this Postgres instance. Server Settings → Maintenance →
 * Scheduled Backups is where it gets turned on.
 *
 * Runs on the SCHEDULER role only (like every other reconciler in this
 * directory), so a multi-process install takes one backup, not one per monitor
 * replica. Ticks every 5 minutes and asks the pure `isScheduledBackupDue` —
 * cheap, and it means a host that was down through its window backs up shortly
 * after boot instead of skipping a day.
 *
 * Import this module from src/app.ts to activate it:
 *   import "./jobs/scheduledBackup.js";

/**
 * src/jobs/reconcileInfraReservations.ts
 *
 * Scheduled safety net: releases reservations held by managed FortiSwitches /
 * FortiAPs whose device is decommissioned or no longer present.
 *
 * The lifecycle hooks (Phase 2a controller cascade, Phase 2b stale-infra sweep,
 * the asset DELETE routes, the operator status change, and the auto-decommission
 * job) all release at the moment the device goes away. This job exists for the
 * cases those can't cover: a decommission that happened while the FortiGate was
 * unreachable, rows created before the release path existed, and any future code
 * path that decommissions a device without calling the hook. Without it, those
 * leak a claimed address — and, once auto-push lands, a real orphaned MAC→IP
 * binding on the gate.
 *
 * Every ~6 hours. Deliberately slow: nothing here is urgent, the hooks handle the
 * common cases immediately, and each pass is bounded so a large backlog drains
 * over several ticks rather than fanning out at the gates. Idempotent — a
 * released row stops matching.
 *
 * Import this module from src/app.ts to activate it.

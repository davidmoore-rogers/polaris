/**
 * src/dash/dashServer.ts — the Dash wallboard listener.
 *
 * A small standalone Express app serving an UNAUTHENTICATED, READ-ONLY
 * duplicate of the Dashboard page at /dash, in its own process
 * (POLARIS_ROLE=dash; also boots in-process under role "all" for dev).
 * nginx proxies `location /dash` here with a URI-preserving proxy_pass, so
 * this app serves everything natively under the /dash prefix and dev
 * direct-access (http://host:3001/dash) matches prod (https://host/dash).
 *
 * Access control, in middleware order (each layer is load-bearing):
 *   1. Operator kill-switch — the `dashConfig` Setting row (Server Settings →
 *      Web Server → Dash Wallboard). Disabled ⇒ 403 for everything. Read
 *      through a ~10s TTL cache, which is also the cross-process propagation
 *      delay for a toggle (the web process writes the row).
 *   2. Source-IP gate — `ipScope` resolves to RFC1918+loopback (default),
 *      "all" (no gate), or "custom" (must match an allow-list CIDR). An
 *      UNAUTHORIZED source is DROPPED (socket destroyed, no response) so a
 *      scanner can't confirm the wallboard exists. Only as trustworthy as the
 *      `trust proxy` posture — nginx mode trusts the first hop's
 *      X-Forwarded-For; direct mode uses the socket address.
 *   3. GET/HEAD-only — every write verb 405s app-wide, which is also why no
 *      session/CSRF middleware is mounted at all.
 *   4. Permission identity — every API request is stamped with the seeded
 *      `readonly` Role's snapshot on req.roleSnapshot, so the mounted REAL
 *      route files (dashboard / reservations / map) enforce their existing
 *      requirePermission / hasPermission gates unmodified, resolving as a
 *      readonly caller. An exact-path allowlist (plus a prefix rule for the
 *      parameterized /weather/ proxy paths) in front of them caps the
 *      exposed surface to the handful of GETs the dashboard widgets call.
 *
 * The process performs NO writes on behalf of dash viewers — widget layout
 * customization persists in the viewer's browser localStorage.

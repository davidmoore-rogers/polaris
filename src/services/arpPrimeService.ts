/**
 * src/services/arpPrimeService.ts — ARP-priming presence sweep.
 *
 * Fire-and-forget UDP datagrams at a list of IPv4 addresses. The point is
 * NOT the datagram itself (nothing listens for a reply): delivering any
 * packet to an IP on a FortiGate-attached subnet forces the FortiGate to
 * ARP-resolve the target on its directly-connected segment. Any live IP
 * stack answers ARP — including hosts that firewall ICMP echo — so a
 * subsequent read of the gate's ARP table (`/api/v2/monitor/network/arp`,
 * discovery Step 3d.55 / 3e.55) captures a fresh MAC↔IP binding for every
 * reachable device. The discovery sync turns matching bindings into
 * `Reservation.lastSeenArp` stamps for stale-reservation detection.
 *
 * Timing matters: FortiOS neighbor-cache entries go STALE within ~15–45s of
 * traffic and an unreferenced entry can be garbage-collected in as little as
 * ~60–90s, so callers sweep, settle briefly (ARP_SETTLE_MS), and pull the
 * table immediately — never schedule other work in between.
 *
 * Reachability is best-effort by design: the datagram only forces an ARP if
 * Polaris can route to the target subnet AND FortiGate policy permits the
 * flow. Where it can't, nothing happens — absence of an ARP entry is never
 * treated as evidence of absence (the stale service only consumes positive
 * signals). Opt-in per integration (`config.arpPresenceSweep`, default off)
 * because an unannounced sweep of every reserved IP is exactly what IDS
 * dashboards flag.
 *
 * Scale: one UDP socket per sweep, one ~1-byte datagram per IP, paced in
 * batches — 2000 targets complete in well under a second of send time. Send
 * errors (unreachable, buffer pressure) are swallowed per-datagram; the
 * sweep never throws.

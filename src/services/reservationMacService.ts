/**
 * src/services/reservationMacService.ts
 *
 * The install-wide placeholder-MAC prefix — the OUI every MAC Polaris generates
 * for a not-yet-racked device's DHCP reservation begins with.
 *
 * Why a setting rather than a constant: the prefix is the ONLY thing marking a
 * reservation's MAC as synthetic (there is no boolean column on Reservation),
 * and it is visible on the FortiGate's own reserved-address table. Sites that
 * already use a locally-administered range for something else need to be able
 * to move Polaris out of the way, and installs that predate this feature need
 * to be able to set it back to "02" to have their existing generated MACs
 * recognized. See the placeholder section of src/utils/mac.ts and
 * placeholderMacAdoptionService.ts.
 *
 * Single Setting row, JSON blob, TTL-cached via createSettingStore — the same
 * shape as assetSourcePriorityService. Read once per discovery run and once per
 * IP-panel open, never on a hot path, so the TTL only bounds how long a
 * just-saved prefix can look unchanged to another role's next run.

// Persistence of each FortiGate's layer-3 neighbour cache into
// `AssetArpEntry`, the current-state table behind the firewall asset's ARP
// Table tab.
//
// The rows are not collected here — they already arrive on every FMG /
// standalone-FortiGate discovery cycle (`DiscoveryResult.arpTable`, read by
// fgtChainArp / fmgStepArp) and, before this, were consumed in memory by three
// passes and thrown away: empty-`ipAddress` enrichment, the Phase 7.6
// `Reservation.lastSeenArp` presence stamp, and Phase 7.7 placeholder-MAC
// adoption. This writer is the fourth consumer and the only one that keeps
// them, so the operator can read the same table the gate answered with.
//
// ── Contract ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Delete-replace per gate, but ONLY for a gate whose ARP query answered this
// cycle (`answeredDevices`, from the per-device `didArpQuery` flag). This is
// the AssetLldpNeighbor rule — `undefined` preserves stored rows, `[]` wipes —
// and it matters more here than usual, because the ARP read is a live monitor
// call that fails routinely: an FMG-proxied read to an offline gate, a device
// whose admin profile lacks monitor scope, a run aborted mid-fleet. Every one
// of those returns nothing, and treating nothing as an empty neighbour cache
// would blank the tab for a healthy gate on the next cycle.
//
// ── Which asset ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// An ARP row names its gate by FortiManager DEVICE NAME, which is emphatically
// not the firewall's hostname (see utils/fortinetParentKey.ts for what that
// conflation has cost). The hop is name → serial (from the run's own
// DiscoveredDevice list) → assetId (the `fortigate-firewall` AssetSource row
// discovery just wrote, whose externalId IS the serial). A gate with no
// resolvable asset is skipped rather than guessed at.

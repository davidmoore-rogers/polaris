/**
 * src/services/reservationStaleService.ts — Stale DHCP-reservation detection.
 *
 * The DHCP discovery sync stamps `Reservation.lastSeenLeased` whenever
 * /api/v2/monitor/system/dhcp confirms an IP is being actively held by a
 * client. The job below reads those timestamps and flags rows whose target
 * has either never been seen online or hasn't been seen in too long. Each
 * transition into "stale" emits one `reservation.stale` Event and stamps
 * `staleNotifiedAt` so the alert doesn't refire daily.
 *
 * The discovery sync clears `staleNotifiedAt` whenever it sees the IP active
 * again, so a reservation that comes back online and then goes silent
 * later will re-arm the alert cleanly.
 *
 * The DHCP lease is not the only presence signal Polaris holds. A device that
 * is *statically* configured with an IP that also has a DHCP reservation never
 * pulls a lease, so `lastSeenLeased` stays null forever — yet the device is
 * online and discovered as an Asset (via FortiGate device inventory / ARP /
 * monitor probe). To avoid flagging those as stale, detection also folds in
 * `Asset.lastSeen` (the no-regress verified-presence timestamp from
 * `bumpLastSeen`) for any Asset that correlates to the reservation by MAC
 * (authoritative — DHCP reservations are MAC→IP) or, failing that, by IP.
 *
 * A third signal, `lastSeenArp`, is stamped by the discovery sync (Phase 7.6
 * in integrations.ts) when the owning FortiGate's ARP table binds the
 * reservation's IP to its reserved MAC — minutes-fresh L2 proof of life that
 * needs no lease, no asset record, and no ICMP reply. The opt-in per-
 * integration `arpPresenceSweep` toggle actively primes the gate's ARP cache
 * (fire-and-forget UDP at each reserved IP, see arpPrimeService.ts) right
 * before the table read so even quiet devices resolve.
 *
 * The effective "last signal" is the freshest of the lease, the ARP
 * confirmation, and the matched asset; a device that is genuinely gone has
 * none of the three fresh, so it still flags correctly.
 *
 * Threshold is admin-tunable via the `reservationStale` Setting
 * (`staleAfterDays`, default 60, 0 = disabled). The grace baseline below
 * absorbs the cold-start case: after the migration deploys, no rows have
 * `lastSeenLeased` populated yet, so we use `max(createdAt, detectionStartedAt)`
 * to avoid flooding the alert list with every existing dhcp_reservation row
 * before discovery has had a chance to populate the column.

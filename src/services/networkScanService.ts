/**
 * src/services/networkScanService.ts — saved network **Discovery** CRUD, run
 * lifecycle, and adoption.
 *
 * The runner (networkScanRunner.ts) does the sweeping; this owns everything
 * around it: the saved configuration, dispatching a run, cancelling one, and
 * turning chosen responders into assets.
 *
 * Two boundaries worth stating up front, because they are what the RBAC design
 * rests on (business rule 34a):
 *
 *   - **Running creates nothing.** `triggerScan` writes a run row and hands it
 *     to a worker. No Asset, no AssetSource, no pin. That is what lets a
 *     `networkScan`-only role sweep a range without being able to add anything
 *     to inventory.
 *   - **Adoption is the only writer of assets here**, and its route chains
 *     `assets:write` on top of `networkScan:write`.
 *
 * A third boundary since the visibility cutover: a Discovery is **private or
 * public**, the SavedDashboard / SavedTableFilter model. Every read and every
 * run resolves through `assertScanVisible`, and an invisible row answers 404
 * rather than 403 (the `GET /alerts/:id` posture — that an id exists is itself
 * something the caller has no business learning). Ownership for EDIT and
 * DELETE is decided by the route, which is where `req.permissionLevel` lives.

 * Assets are created exactly like the manual `POST /assets` path — fields
 * inline, `ipSource="manual"`, and the `db.ts` extension minting the `manual`
 * AssetSource row. There is deliberately **no `network-scan` sourceKind**:
 * `projectAssetFromSources` has zero rules for a kind outside its union, so
 * such a row would contribute nothing to the projection while
 * `projectionDriftService` compared projection against the stored row — a
 * drift-log generator. Provenance goes where discovery already puts it, the
 * one-time notes boilerplate plus an audit Event.
 *
 * Pins are resolved by the SAME pure resolvers the integration auto-monitor
 * pass uses, against the inventory the scan collected, so a selection means the
 * same thing here as it does there.

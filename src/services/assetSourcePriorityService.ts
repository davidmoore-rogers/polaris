/**
 * src/services/assetSourcePriorityService.ts
 *
 * Operator-settable priority for the Assets table's **Sources** column — which
 * discovery source's "where was this learned?" answer wins when an asset is
 * known to several at once. Single Setting row (`assetSourcePriority`), JSON
 * blob, TTL-cached via createSettingStore.
 *
 * The value feeds `Asset.learnedLocation` through the projection, NOT just the
 * column's rendering. That's deliberate: the Sources column, its text filter,
 * its sort, "behind FortiGate X" tag/maintenance criteria and the Device Map's
 * per-site narrowing all read learnedLocation, so deciding the winner at render
 * time would make the column disagree with everything that filters on it.
 *
 * Because the projection runs inside the DISCOVERY process (a separate process
 * in the split-role layout) the write can't push the new order in-process.
 * Propagation is pull-based: refreshProjectionPriority() runs at boot and at
 * the start of every discovery run, so an edit lands on the next run — which is
 * also the next moment learnedLocation is written, so nothing is ever stale in
 * a way an operator can observe. Existing rows re-project on that run; the
 * order change is not retroactive on its own.

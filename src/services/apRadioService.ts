/**
 * src/services/apRadioService.ts — FortiAP radio + broadcast-SSID inventory.
 *
 * The two levels ABOVE a wireless station: which radios an AP has (channel,
 * width, power, PHY) and which SSIDs each one broadcasts. Together with
 * AssetWirelessStation they render the Stations tab as a radio → SSID →
 * station tree, and AssetApVap is the inventory behind the "Broadcast SSID"
 * device-filter condition field.
 *
 * TWO SOURCES, one row per radio. The controller's
 * /api/v2/monitor/wifi/managed_ap `radio[]` array (source "fortios") reaches
 * every managed AP — including the many with SNMP disabled, which is why it
 * is the primary — and carries the SSIDs, the BSSIDs and a power PERCENTAGE.
 * The AP's own FORTINET-FORTIAP-MIB fapRadioTable (source "snmp") carries the
 * configured and maximum tx power the controller never publishes — as bare
 * integers the module states no unit for, which is why those columns are
 * named for what they are rather than for a unit nobody has confirmed.
 *
 * So the write MERGES per column rather than replacing the row: a null from a
 * source that does not collect a column never erases what the other source
 * established. The cost of that choice, stated plainly: a column cannot be
 * cleared back to null by a scrape — a stored tx-power ceiling survives until
 * some source reports a different one. That is the right trade for inventory
 * two sources describe from different angles, and the wrong one for a
 * reading, which is why nothing fluctuating (channel utilization, noise
 * floor) is stored here at all.
 *
 * Radio IDENTITY is not merged. Both sources enumerate every radio, so a
 * radioIndex absent from a scrape is a radio that is genuinely gone and its
 * row (and its VAPs) are deleted. VAPs follow the codebase's usual
 * undefined-vs-empty contract one level down: a radio whose sample carries no
 * `vaps` field was not asked about its SSIDs and keeps the ones it has, while
 * an empty array means it was asked and is broadcasting nothing.
 *
 * VAP identity is where the two sources needed reconciling. The table keys on
 * `vapName`, but the sources do not agree on one: FortiOS publishes the VAP
 * OBJECT's name, the MIB publishes only the SSID. Keying on the name alone
 * would have each source insert its own row and delete the other's on every
 * pass — churn on a tree an operator is reading, with `firstSeen` reset each
 * time. They do agree on the BSSID, so that is matched FIRST and the name is
 * treated as an attribute of the matched row: the controller's name wins when
 * they differ (it is the operator's own), unless another VAP on that radio
 * already holds it.

/**
 * src/services/assetSightingService.ts — Asset → FortiGate sighting log
 *
 * Records every (asset, FortiGate) pair where discovery has handed out a DHCP
 * lease/reservation to the asset. Drives the quarantine fan-out:
 * `assetQuarantineService` reads this log to pick which FortiGates to push
 * the asset's MACs to. Only DHCP-level evidence is recorded — transit
 * sightings via the System tab's interface scrape are intentionally
 * excluded so we don't quarantine an asset on a FortiGate that just
 * happened to ARP for its IP.
 *
 * Settings:
 *   quarantine.sightingMaxAgeDays — default 180. Sightings whose `lastSeen`
 *     is older than this are filtered out by `getQuarantineCandidates` so a
 *     laptop that hasn't been at a site for 6+ months doesn't push to that
 *     site's FortiGate. 0 disables the filter (every recorded sighting is
 *     a candidate forever). Stored rows are not deleted by this setting —
 *     pruning is a separate operation if/when we add it.

/**
 * Which assets' FRESHEST FortiGate sighting is about to change gate — i.e.
 * "this device moved from behind gate A to behind gate B".
 *
 * Freshest = max lastSeen across the asset's sighting rows, the same rule
 * `syncEndpointDependencyEdges` uses to pick an endpoint's parent gate, so this
 * event tracks the value that actually drives dependency suppression. A gate
 * move inserts a NEW row rather than updating one (the unique key includes
 * fortigateDevice) and nothing prunes the old row, which is why "freshest"
 * rather than "only" is the question.
 *
 * Pure — the caller supplies the current rows and the incoming batch.
 *
 * Three deliberate silences:
 *  - An asset with no current rows is a FIRST sighting, not a move.
 *  - Devices compare after `bareFortinetDeviceName` + case folding, so the same
 *    gate written with and without an integration prefix isn't a change.
 *  - THE TAKEOVER GUARD: nothing is reported while the incumbent gate is ALSO
 *    being refreshed in this same batch. A device with a live lease on one gate
 *    and a not-yet-expired lease on another has both rows stamped to ~now every
 *    run, so "freshest" tie-flips every cycle and would emit forever. Requiring
 *    the incumbent to fall silent means a real move is reported once the old
 *    gate stops handing the device an address — later than the move itself (by
 *    up to the old lease's life), but the alternative is a permanent flap.

/**
 * src/services/topologyLayoutService.ts
 *
 * Shared Device Map topology layouts — the server-persisted counterpart of
 * the browser's old localStorage-only node positions. One TopologyLayout row
 * per (siteId, view): siteId is the FortiGate Asset id the topology graph is
 * rooted on; view is "flat" or a floor-view key from computeFloorViews
 * ("b|<area>|<building>" / "f|<area>|<building>|<floor>"). `positions` is
 * { [nodeId]: { x, y } } in pixel model coordinates — the exact shape
 * map.js saves/loads, so the client can treat server and localStorage
 * layouts interchangeably (server wins, localStorage is the per-browser
 * fallback for non-writers).
 *
 * Two blobs per row. `positions` is the LIVE layout -- rewritten by the
 * client's debounced drag save, shared with every viewer. `savedPositions`
 * is the operator's RESTORE POINT, written only by an explicit Save, which
 * is what makes "Reset to last save" a different thing from "Reset to
 * baseline": the first copies the restore point back over the live blob, the
 * second clears the live blob and keeps the restore point (a row with no
 * restore point is deleted outright).
 *
 * Full-replace semantics per (site, view): each save overwrites the whole
 * blob, so nodeIds that left the topology age out on the next save and
 * concurrent editors are last-write-wins (updatedBy/updatedAt are stored
 * for a future conditional write).

/**
 * src/services/placeholderMacAdoptionService.ts
 *
 * Replace a reservation's PLACEHOLDER MAC with the real one once discovery sees
 * an actual device answering at that reserved IP — in Polaris and on the gate.
 *
 * The problem it solves: a DHCP reservation is a MAC→IP binding, so reserving an
 * IP for a device that isn't racked yet needs a MAC before there is a device to
 * supply one. The IP panel's "Generate" button synthesizes one. That entry then
 * sits on the FortiGate matching nothing: when the device finally arrives it
 * DHCPs with its real MAC, misses the reservation, and takes a pool address
 * instead. The reservation looks correct on both sides and silently does
 * nothing, forever, until a human notices and retypes the MAC.
 *
 * SAFETY — this overwrites a stored MAC and writes DHCP configuration to
 * production network devices on a schedule:
 *   • Opt-in twice. `config.pushReservations` is the transport gate and
 *     `config.adoptDiscoveredMac` is this feature; both must be on. Off by
 *     default, on both Fortinet integration types.
 *   • Only ever overwrites a PLACEHOLDER. `isPlaceholderMac` against the
 *     operator's configured prefix is the single condition that makes an
 *     unattended overwrite defensible — an operator-typed real MAC is never
 *     touched, whatever discovery saw. The prefix is required to be
 *     locally-administered (see utils/mac.ts) precisely so no real device's
 *     factory MAC can fall inside that space.
 *   • Device-scoped evidence only. ARP and device-inventory rows are keyed by
 *     the FortiGate that reported them, so overlapping RFC1918 subnets behind
 *     different gates can't cross-match — the same rule Phase 7.6 already
 *     follows for ARP presence.
 *   • Device first, Polaris second. The gate write goes through
 *     `updatePushedReservation` (which verifies by read-back) BEFORE the Polaris
 *     row changes, so the two views can't diverge. This is why the pass lives
 *     here rather than as another bare `prisma.reservation.update` inside the
 *     discovery engine.
 *   • Bounded + paced, per RUN. See `AdoptionBudget` below — in FMG mode the
 *     sync runs once per managed FortiGate, so a per-call ceiling would multiply
 *     by gate count.
 *   • No retry into the ground. A permanent refusal is recorded as
 *     `failed_permanent` on the row, which also removes it from the candidate
 *     set; transient failures are simply retried next cycle.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT evidence: DHCP lease entries (a device whose MAC doesn't
 * match the reservation never gets the reserved address, so it can't appear
 * there) and `Asset.ipAddress` (not device-scoped, and an asset's IP can be
 * learned from an unrelated source).

/**
 * src/services/sshHostKeyService.ts — trust-on-first-use pinning for SSH
 * SERVER host keys.
 *
 * THE GAP THIS CLOSES. Polaris passed no `hostVerifier` to ssh2, so every SSH
 * connection accepted whatever host key was presented — the server was never
 * authenticated to the client. That affects three paths equally: agent
 * install/upgrade/uninstall (which SFTPs a script and runs it as root),
 * agentless process collection, and the SSH monitor probe. Anyone able to
 * answer on the target's address could impersonate it and, in the install
 * case, be handed a credential.
 *
 * WHY A TABLE AND NOT Credential.config. Host keys are per-HOST; a credential
 * spans a fleet. One `ssh` credential legitimately reaches thousands of
 * machines, each with its own key.
 *
 * OPT-IN, MIRRORING `verifyTls`. Enabling this globally would break every
 * install whose hosts have never been pinned, so it rides
 * `SshConfig.verifyHostKey`, default OFF, default ON for newly created
 * credentials — exactly the shape the WinRM `verifyTls` remediation used
 * (2026-06-03 review, H1).
 *
 * TOFU IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE MOMENT YOU PIN. Turning this on against a
 * running fleet pins whatever currently answers; it detects a key CHANGING,
 * not a host that was already impersonated. It is genuinely strong for a
 * greenfield rollout (pin at deploy time, when the host is known-good) and
 * worth saying plainly in the UI rather than implying more than it delivers.
 *
 * HOT PATH. `withSshClient` runs on the per-minute agentless-processes cadence
 * across the fleet, so the lookup is served from a module-level Map and only
 * misses hit Postgres. Same shape as the role-snapshot cache in
 * permissions.ts.

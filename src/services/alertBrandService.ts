/**
 * src/services/alertBrandService.ts — the install's identity, in the corner of
 * the alert email.
 *
 * An alert lands in an inbox next to mail from every other system a site runs,
 * and the body's own severity bar says nothing about WHO sent it. This puts the
 * install's logo, application name and subtitle in the top-right of the card,
 * opposite the headline — the masthead position, so it reads as letterhead
 * rather than as content.
 *
 * Three things it deliberately reuses rather than re-decides:
 *
 *  - **It is a DEFERRED token** (`{brand.header}`, see isDeferredToken), filled
 *    at delivery like `{chart.*}` and `{interface.lldp}` — for the same two
 *    reasons: the logo is an inline CID attachment (no remote images in email,
 *    and a data: URI is dropped by Gmail and Outlook alike), which one context
 *    string can't carry, and its HTML and plain-text forms are different markup.
 *    A fire-time context key would also freeze the branding into every
 *    escalation email sent hours later.
 *
 *  - **Which artwork** follows business rule 27 rather than picking a file: the
 *    shipped art is theme-paired, and the email card is white, so the LIGHT
 *    variant (near-black ink) is the only one that doesn't disappear. The
 *    horizontal wordmark is the shipped choice because it already spells the
 *    product name — which is exactly why the name is NOT printed beside it
 *    (rule 27's showName=false: the picture already says it). An operator's own
 *    logo has no wordmark we know of, so it gets the name as its caption, and
 *    the accent composite when they enabled one.
 *
 *  - **The subtitle renders either way** — it is the operator's own line of
 *    copy, not a caption for the mark.
 *
 * Nothing here throws and nothing here is required: every failure rung drops
 * the logo, then the whole block, and the email sends without it. Letterhead
 * must never be the reason an alert doesn't arrive.

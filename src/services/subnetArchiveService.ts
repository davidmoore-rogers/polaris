/**
 * src/services/subnetArchiveService.ts — retiring a subnet without letting it
 * squat on its CIDR (business rule 41).
 *
 * WHY AN ARCHIVE AND NOT A STATUS
 * `Subnet.status = "deprecated"` marks a subnet retired but leaves the row in
 * place, and the row still holds `@@unique([blockId, cidr])`. So a replacement
 * FortiGate serving the same address space could not be recorded at all:
 * discovery's lookup index skips deprecated rows (no update path) while
 * `createSubnetRowChecked`'s committed-state overlap check counts them (no
 * create path), and every such subnet came back as
 * `Skipped subnet 10.x.0.0/24: Subnet 10.x.0.0/24 overlaps with existing
 * subnet 10.x.0.0/24` on every run — taking that subnet's leases, DHCP
 * reservations, VIPs and interface IPs down with it, since `findSubnetForIp`
 * skips deprecated rows too. Moving the row OUT is what frees the CIDR.
 *
 * It also makes the retired data LOCKED by construction rather than by
 * enforcement. An archived reservation is not in `reservations` at all, so none
 * of the ~50 reservation write sites can reach it — no guard to add in fifty
 * places, and no future writer to forget one. Compare `assertNotDeviceOwned`,
 * which has to sit at the route layer precisely because discovery still writes
 * the rows it protects.
 *
 * TWO ENTRY POINTS, AND THE DIFFERENCE MATTERS
 *   snapshotSubnet()  — copies the subnet + its reservations into the archive
 *                       and leaves the live rows ALONE. Additive. Used by the
 *                       chassis-replacement path, where the archive is the
 *                       evidence an operator resolves the conflict against and
 *                       nothing should be destroyed on the strength of an
 *                       automatic detection.
 *   archiveSubnet()   — snapshot, then DELETE the live subnet (its reservations
 *                       cascade). The operator's explicit "retire this" action,
 *                       and the thing that frees the CIDR.
 *
 * archiveSubnet deliberately does NOT enforce business rule 4's active-
 * reservation protection. That protection exists to stop an accidental
 * DESTRUCTION; archiving preserves everything it moves, which is the opposite.

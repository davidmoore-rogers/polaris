/**

 *
 * "When was this device unreachable?", answered from the response-time probe
 * stream — for the charts of streams that have no failure record of their own.
 *
 * The heavy cadences (telemetry / hardware sensors / interfaces / storage /
 * processes) do not run while an asset is down: `runsHeavyCadences` gates them
 * on `up`, so a skipped poll leaves no row at all and there is nothing in those
 * tables to mark. The response-time probe DOES keep running in every state — it
 * is what decides whether the device is down in the first place — and it writes
 * a real `success:false` row every interval. So the authoritative record of an
 * outage already exists, in the one stream that was still measuring; the other
 * charts borrow it rather than storing a second copy.
 *
 * This replaces the 2.5x-median-cadence gap heuristic the charts used to infer
 * failures with (see UI-GUIDE section 15). That guess could not tell an outage
 * apart from a mount that was unmounted, a metric that simply isn't collected
 * on this device, or an operator widening the cadence — and it drew a red dive
 * straight through maintenance windows, which is backwards: a band means the
 * gap is explained, a dive means it isn't. Reading the probe stream gets all of
 * those right without a special case, because polling stops entirely during
 * maintenance, so a maintenance gap contains no failed probes and yields no
 * outage.
 *
 * Windows are CLASSIFIED, not merely found: a stretch whose every failure was
 * taken while the asset was dependency-suppressed comes back as
 * kind="dependency" and is drawn grey, because Polaris knows exactly why those
 * probes missed — the upstream was dark. Red is reserved for the outage nobody
 * can account for. The evidence is per-sample (AssetMonitorSample
 * .dependencyDown) rather than reconstructed from the suppression history,
 * which no table keeps.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a write path. An earlier design wrote synthetic failure rows
 * into the telemetry/storage/interface tables so those streams would carry
 * their own flag. Rejected: those tables are read raw by the alert engine, the
 * hourly/daily rollups and the vanished-state sweep, none of which can tell a
 * real reading from a marker, and the rows would have had to invent a
 * `mountPath` / `ifName` for a poll that never ran.

/**
 * Why the probes in a window failed.
 *
 *   "outage"     — nothing explains it. The device stopped answering and
 *                  Polaris does not know why. Charts draw the red dive.
 *   "dependency" — the asset was dependency-suppressed for every failure in
 *                  the window: its parent was dark, so the miss is expected.
 *                  Charts draw the same shape in grey, because the claim is
 *                  "we could not reach it THROUGH the outage upstream", not
 *                  "this device broke".
 *   "missed"     — the probes failed but the count has NOT yet reached the
 *                  covering automation's `missedPolls` (business rule 36), so
 *                  Polaris has not called the device down. Charts draw the same
 *                  shape in amber — the Last-30-min strip's "Missed" cell — and
 *                  the run turns red at the probe that crosses the threshold.
 *
 * A window is only "dependency" when EVERY failure in it was suppressed. A run
 * that starts before the parent goes down splits into an "outage" window and a
 * "dependency" one at the boundary, which is the honest reading: the first
 * misses were unexplained at the time they happened. A run that crosses the
 * missed-poll threshold splits the same way and for the same reason: the early
 * misses were not a verdict when they happened.
 *
 * Only a caller that KNOWS the threshold can produce "missed" — `readProbeOutages`
 * never does, because the charts it feeds (CPU, memory, storage, interfaces) are
 * about a reading rather than a verdict and draw one red dive either way. It
 * reaches the response-time chart through `alertChartService.failSpansFrom`,
 * which is handed the count.

 * vocabulary exists to prevent.
 *
 * The rules, in the order they decide:
 *
 *   cf >= threshold                    down        (the verdict)
 *   cf > 0, this probe missed          warning     (a miss, not yet a verdict)

 *   since the outage is still short    recovering  (rule 36's way back up)
 *   otherwise                          up
 *
 * THE LEVEL DECIDES; this probe's own outcome only breaks the tie below the
 * threshold. `threshold === null` is the PASSIVE device — no automation defines
 * down for it, so nothing may ever read `down` — spelled `Infinity` rather than
 * a second loop. `recoveryPolls` is the covering automation's reset already
 * converted to a poll count; below the missed-poll count it changes nothing,
 * because the bucket's drain is the floor.
 *

 * debt it has no samples for. Same assumption as the browser copy.

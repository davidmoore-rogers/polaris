/**
 * src/services/assetQuarantineService.ts — Push / release asset MAC
 * quarantine on FortiGates.
 *
 * Pushes every MAC associated with an asset to every FortiGate the asset
 * has been recently sighted on (per assetSightingService) using the
 * persistent FortiOS user.quarantine.targets CMDB tree. Each Polaris-
 * managed quarantine becomes a single target named `polaris-<short-id>`
 * on the FortiGate, with one MAC entry per associated MAC. Release
 * removes that entry from the table.
 *
 * ── FortiOS endpoint, as the device describes it ────────────────────────
 * Every read and write goes through ONE resource:
 *
 *     GET /api/v2/cmdb/user/quarantine          → the whole object
 *     PUT /api/v2/cmdb/user/quarantine          → { targets: [ … ] }
 *
 * `user.quarantine` is a COMPLEX (single) object whose `targets` child table
 * holds one entry per quarantined device, keyed on `entry`, each carrying a
 * `macs` child table keyed on `mac`. Ask any gate and it will say so:
 *
 *     GET /api/v2/cmdb/user/quarantine?action=schema
 *
 * which is the authority for a given build — not this comment. It also
 * publishes `access_group: "wifi"`, i.e. the REST API admin needs WiFi &
 * Switch Controller write, and the field sizes (both descriptions: 63).
 *
 * The child table has NO collection resource. This service previously
 * assumed one and it does not exist:
 *
 *     POST   /api/v2/cmdb/user/quarantine/targets          → 405
 *     DELETE /api/v2/cmdb/user/quarantine/targets/<entry>   → likewise unreal
 *
 * FortiOS exposes POST/DELETE on a child table only where the parent is
 * itself a table and the URL carries the parent's mkey (the
 * `/firewall/policy/1/srcaddr` shape); this parent has no mkey. Create,
 * release and rollback were therefore all broken by one fact, which is why
 * they now share a single mechanism. See "The write mechanism" below for the
 * read-modify-write hazard that follows from PUTting a shared table, and
 * `tests/unit/quarantineRequestShape.test.ts` for the guards.
 *
 * ── Transport ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Identical to reservationPushService:
 *   - useProxy=true  → wrap each call in FMG `/sys/proxy/json`
 *   - useProxy=false → resolve the device's mgmt IP via FMG, then call
 *                       the FortiGate REST API directly with
 *                       `fortigateApiUser` / `fortigateApiToken`.
 *
 * ── Atomicity ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Per-FortiGate is all-or-nothing: a partial-target write rolls back by
 * deleting the target before throwing. Across-FortiGate is best-effort:
 * if 3 of 5 sites succeed, the asset still flips to `quarantined` and
 * the failed targets are recorded as `status: "failed"` in
 * `Asset.quarantineTargets[]` so an operator can retry.

/**
 * ── The write mechanism ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `user.quarantine` is a COMPLEX (single) object and `targets` is a child table
 * inside it, which FortiOS states in its own schema
 * (`GET /api/v2/cmdb/user/quarantine?action=schema` → `"category": "complex"`).
 * A child table of a single object has no addressable collection resource: a
 * `POST /api/v2/cmdb/user/quarantine/targets` answers **405 Method Not
 * Allowed**, whatever the body. FortiOS exposes POST/DELETE on a child table
 * only when the parent is itself a table and the URL carries the parent's mkey
 * (`/firewall/policy/1/srcaddr`); this parent has no mkey.
 *
 * So every write goes through ONE mechanism — `PUT /api/v2/cmdb/user/quarantine`
 * carrying the whole `targets` array — used by create, reconcile, rollback AND
 * release alike. That is deliberate: the previous design used POST to create and
 * DELETE on the child path to release and to roll back, so release was broken in
 * exactly the same way as create and neither could be fixed alone. A partial PUT
 * naming only `targets` leaves the object's other attributes (`quarantine`,
 * `traffic-policy`, `firewall-groups`) untouched, so the blast radius is the
 * targets table itself.
 *
 * Which raises the hazard that shapes everything below: **that table is not
 * ours.** The gate's own Quarantine Host action, NAC policies and automation
 * stitches write entries there too, and a full-array PUT deletes whatever it
 * omits. Hence read-modify-write with three guards:
 *
 *   - foreign entries are carried through VERBATIM apart from device-owned
 *     readonly fields, which FortiOS refuses on write (`parent`, and the
 *     `q_origin_key` some builds decorate reads with);
 *   - the read-back verifies not just that OUR entry landed but that every
 *     foreign entry survived, and restores the snapshot if one did not;
 *   - the rollback restores the exact array that was read, rather than deleting
 *     our entry, so a failure cannot leave the table shorter than it started.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION: read-modify-write over a shared table has a lost-update
 * window, and FortiOS CMDB offers no ETag or compare-and-set to close it. Two
 * pushes to the same gate are serialized within a process
 * (`withQuarantineLane`), but Polaris runs split-role, so an operator-initiated
 * push from the web role and an auto-quarantine from the discovery role can
 * still interleave. The foreign-entry check turns the bad outcome from silent
 * entry loss into a failed push with the table restored. Quarantine is a rare,
 * operator-paced action, so that trade is deliberate rather than merely
 * tolerated.

 * toggle off, so with it off fleet-wide a push resolves to zero targets and
 * the operator gets a 502 reading "0/0 FortiGate(s) accepted the push" — a
 * failure that describes a device problem when the real answer is that the
 * feature was never turned on. The frontends call this to hide the quarantine
 * verbs rather than offer a button that can only fail.
 *
 * Deliberately install-wide rather than per-asset: the per-asset answer needs
 * each asset's sightings joined to their integrations, and the row menu asks
 * this question for every row of a 2000-asset table. On a multi-integration
 * install where only some carry the toggle this is therefore the OPTIMISTIC
 * answer — the push stays the authority, and its per-target records still name
 * the FortiGates it skipped.
 *
 * Release is NOT gated on it: `releaseQuarantine` unpushes from the targets
 * recorded on the asset without consulting the toggle, so an asset quarantined
 * before push was switched off must stay releasable.

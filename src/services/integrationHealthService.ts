 * fetches this on every page for every signed-in session, and neither signal is
 * worth a second poll of its own.
 *
 *   failed       — enabled integrations whose most recent connection test failed.
 *   proxyAdvice  — enabled FortiManager integrations still on the proxy
 *                  transport that manage more gates than proxy mode scales to.
 *
 * The proxy advisory is about THROUGHPUT, not capability. FMG forwards
 * per-device live queries through `/sys/proxy/json`, which FortiManager
 * serializes at concurrency 1 (see fmgWorker.ts) — so a poll cycle grows
 * linearly with the managed-gate count while direct mode parallelises up to 20.
 * Proxy mode's separate inability to collect a FortiGate's REST monitoring
 * streams is a real but SEPARATE (and fixable) problem; deliberately not
 * mentioned here, or this advisory would read as wrong the moment that lands.

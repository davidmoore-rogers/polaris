/**
 * src/services/probePatchBuffer.ts
 *
 * Periodic batch-flush buffer for the per-probe `Asset` row update issued by
 * `recordProbeResult` (monitorStatus, lastMonitorAt, lastResponseTimeMs,
 * consecutiveFailures / consecutiveSuccesses, monitorStatusChangedAt). At
 * 2000+ monitored assets the cheap response-time probe fires once per asset
 * per resolved interval — each probe used to issue one `prisma.asset.update`
 * which consumes one Prisma pool connection and holds it across the network
 * round-trip + lock acquisition. The cumulative result was the largest
 * remaining per-tick connection draw on the monitor hot loop.
 *
 * Buffer semantics
 * ────────────────
 * The buffer is a `Map<assetId, ProbePatch>` of in-flight state writes,
 * flushed as one bulk `UPDATE ... FROM (VALUES ...)` statement per 2 s
 * window. Within one window, a second probe for the same asset overwrites
 * the first patch (last-write-wins) EXCEPT for `monitorStatusChangedAt` —
 * if probe N transitioned (stamp set) and probe N+1 didn't (stamp omitted),
 * we preserve probe N's stamp on merge so the DB ends up with the actual
 * transition timestamp instead of NULL-erasing it.
 *
 * Read-your-writes
 * ────────────────
 * The five-state machine in `recordProbeResult` computes the next state
 * from `monitorStatus + consecutiveFailures + consecutiveSuccesses`. Those
 * three columns can be up to one flush window stale on disk, so the
 * recordProbeResult call site overlays the pending buffer entry onto the
 * loaded Asset row BEFORE running the state machine. Without this, two
 * back-to-back failed probes in the same window would each compute
 * `newCf = 1` against the on-disk `consecutiveFailures = 0`, and the
 * threshold counting would silently break.
 *
 * Failure mode
 * ────────────
 * On flush failure (after `retryOnDeadlock` exhausts retries), the stale
 * snapshot is conditionally re-prepended: each (assetId, patch) pair is
 * restored only if the buffer no longer holds an entry for that asset.
 * Concurrent enqueues that landed during the awaited write represent
 * fresher state and win; the failed snapshot fills the gaps. Trade-off:
 * up to 2 s of state writes can be lost on a hard crash. Acceptable
 * because the next probe tick observes current state (the row in DB is
 * just one cycle behind on counters) and recomputes — the state machine
 * is self-healing within one additional probe cycle.
 *
 * SIGTERM-safe: `shutdownFlushProbePatchBuffer()` is awaited from the
 * graceful-shutdown hook in `app.ts` so any in-flight state writes drain
 * before the process exits.
 *
 * Trade-off documented vs the sampleWriteBuffer's append-only contract:
 * this buffer holds STATE writes (last-write-wins per asset), not
 * append-only time-series rows. The contracts are different by design;
 * the in-memory shape (Map<id, patch> vs Array<row>), the merge rule
 * (last-write-wins-with-stamp-preservation vs concat), and the flush
 * SQL (UPDATE FROM VALUES vs createMany) are all chosen accordingly.

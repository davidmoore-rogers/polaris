/**
 * src/utils/assetTypeMatch.ts
 *
 * The device-type INFERENCE layer: which discovery-time facts land a device in
 * which `AssetTypeDef` bucket. Pure (no DB imports) so the discovery engine,
 * the Network Discovery adopter and the preview endpoint all run the same
 * decision, and so a unit test can exercise it without a database.
 *
 * The rules are a **nested AND/OR condition tree** — the same grammar the
 * automations device filter stores (`op` ∈ and/or/none/notAll over children
 * that are either a leaf or another group), edited in the same shared
 * `PolarisConditionBuilder` widget. It was a flat ANY-of clause list until
 * 2026-09: that was a faithful transcription of the `||` ladders this layer
 * replaced, but it meant an operator who wanted "a Windows box that is NOT a
 * server" had to express it as one regex, and it made Polaris carry two
 * condition dialects that looked alike and behaved differently in the same
 * settings page. The stored shape converges; the EVALUATOR does not, and
 * cannot — see "Why the evaluator stays separate" below.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately is NOT:
 *
 *  - **It is not how every device gets its type.** A FortiSwitch discovered
 *    from its controller's CMDB *is* a switch, and a vCenter host *is* a
 *    hypervisor — those are identity, read off an authoritative source, and
 *    they stay hardcoded. Rules only decide the cases where Polaris would
 *    otherwise be guessing from a text field. `AUTHORITATIVE_TYPE_SOURCES`
 *    below is the catalogue the Device Types card renders so an operator can
 *    see which buckets their rules cannot affect and why.
 *
 *  - **It is not retroactive.** The resolver answers about ONE device's facts
 *    at the moment discovery sees them. Re-typing existing inventory after a
 *    rule edit is a separate, explicit operator action (see
 *    `assetTypeService.applyMatchRules`), bounded to assets currently sitting
 *    in `other` — the same guard the discovery engine has always applied
 *    before re-typing an existing asset.
 *
 * Contexts exist because the two hardcoded predicates this replaces asked
 * different questions of different inputs. `inferAssetTypeFromOs` read an OS
 * string from a directory record and could only answer server / workstation /
 * other; `assetTypeForHit` read a scanned device's own self-description and
 * could answer firewall / switch / access_point / router / printer. Merging
 * them into one rule set would have silently started typing AD computers
 * "printer" off an OS string, so each type declares which contexts its rules
 * run in and the seed migration reproduces the old split exactly.
 *
 * ── Why the evaluator stays separate ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `evaluateScopeCondition` (notificationTypes.ts) filters ASSET ROWS: stored
 * columns, tags, regions, CIDR containment, joined relations. These rules
 * match FACTS about a device that has no Asset row yet — a scan hit, a
 * directory record mid-sync — over a vocabulary of raw strings. Two
 * consequences that must not be smoothed over just because one widget now
 * edits both:
 *
 *  - The FIELD sets are disjoint on purpose. There is no `tag`, `subnet`,
 *    `status` or `assetType` at inference time; there is a `chassis` string
 *    and an `any`-of-the-facts pseudo-field that mean nothing to an Asset row.
 *
 *  - **An ABSENT fact never matches, either polarity.** In a device filter,
 *    `notContains "x"` on a NULL column is satisfied (the column plainly does
 *    not contain it). Here it is NOT: at discovery time a missing fact means
 *    *not yet known*, so letting absence satisfy a negation is how one silent
 *    field outage re-types a fleet. That is the one place an operator can read
 *    the same row in two builders and get two answers, so both the field
 *    labels and the card's own prose say it.

 *
 * **Kept in lockstep with the seed migration**
 * (`20260901010000_asset_type_match_rules`), which is where EXISTING installs
 * get their rules; this constant only reaches rows that
 * `seedBuiltInAssetTypes` has to create from scratch (a `prisma migrate reset`
 * or a nuked volume). The two can't share source — one is SQL — and since
 * 2026-09 they don't even share a SHAPE: the migration wrote the flat
 * `{clauses:[…]}` list, which `normalizeMatchRules` folds to the same OR tree
 * these literals spell out. That is exactly why
 * `tests/unit/assetTypeMatch.test.ts` pins the behavior both must produce
 * rather than the text.
 *
 * A type absent from this table (`other`, `hypervisor`, `kubernetes_cluster`)
 * ships with no rules on purpose: `other` is the fallback rather than a match,
 * and the other two are only ever assigned by an authoritative source.

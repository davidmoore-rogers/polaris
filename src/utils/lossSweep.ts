/**
 * src/utils/lossSweep.ts — who gets burst-pinged, and how often. The pure
 * decision layer behind the ICMP loss sweep; the measurement itself is
 * `utils/burstPing.ts` and the wiring is monitorAssets + monitoringService.
 *
 * THIS REPLACES utils/lossSampler.ts, and the difference is the whole point.
 * The old sampler ran ONLY while an asset was `warning` or `recovering` — a
 * 10s side-probe during a run, per asset, to give the ratio more samples than
 * the poll cadence could. It was disabled a day after it shipped (business
 * rule 29d) because that window IS a sampling bias: it sampled precisely when
 * probes were already failing, so failure periods were oversampled and the
 * alert's reading diverged visibly from the wall-clock average its own chart
 * drew. There is no way to correct that bias after the fact; the only fix is
 * to stop creating it.
 *
 * So the sweep is UNIFORM: every eligible asset, every cycle, the same burst,
 * whatever state it is in. A ratio over uniformly-spaced bursts means what an
 * operator thinks it means. That is affordable now only because the pinger is
 * batched — 2000 assets cost 4 fping spawns, where the old per-asset design
 * cost 2000 and could not have run fleet-wide at any cadence.
 *
 * ELIGIBILITY, and why each exclusion is narrow:
 *
 *   - `monitored` must be true. Business rule 10 already forces it false for
 *     the four unmonitorable statuses, so this one test covers them.
 *   - `maintenance` is excluded explicitly, because it is the one status that
 *     KEEPS `monitored` true while all server-driven polling stops (rule 16).
 *   - `responseTimePolling === "disabled"` is excluded: that is the operator
 *     saying do not reach out to this device, and rule 30 already honours it
 *     as a skip rather than a miss. Nothing else about the polling METHOD is
 *     consulted — an agent-monitored host still sits on a network whose packet
 *     loss is a real fact, and letting "I use the agent for status" silently
 *     disable loss measurement would be a surprise.
 *
 * AND TWO THINGS THE OLD SAMPLER EXCLUDED THAT THIS ONE DELIBERATELY KEEPS:
 *
 *   - `down` assets. The old exclusion was a corroboration argument: with every
 *     poll failing, an ICMP reply is the only evidence, and a host that had
 *     taken over the address would drag a dead device's loss down to something
 *     reading like congestion. That reasoning was load-bearing when loss shared
 *     a stream with down detection. It no longer does — the sweep NEVER calls
 *     recordProbeResult, so nothing here can move monitorStatus, and the
 *     engine's own answering gate keeps a down device from raising a loss
 *     alert at all (business rule 29a). Excluding them would just punch a hole
 *     in the series at the exact moment an operator wants to read it.
 *   - Dependency-suppressed assets. Excluding them was a COST argument — a site
 *     outage would have put every asset behind a dead gate into a 10s ping loop
 *     at the busiest possible moment. Batched, that same outage costs five
 *     extra packets per asset inside a sweep that was already running. The
 *     failures are still marked explained: the sweep stamps
 *     AssetMonitorSample.dependencyDown exactly as the probe path does, so the
 *     charts draw them grey rather than as an accusation (business rule 38b).

/**
 * src/utils/dashboardLayout.ts — the ONE definition of a dashboard column.
 *
 * A dashboard canvas is an ordered list of COLUMNS, each with a 12-grid width
 * and a vertical stack of widget instances (see public/js/dashboard.js). Two
 * server surfaces store that shape and must never disagree about it:
 *
 *   - `UserDashboard.layout` — the caller's own multi-dashboard layout
 *     (src/api/routes/userDashboard.ts), where the columns sit one level down
 *     inside `dashboards[]`.
 *   - `SavedDashboard.layout` — a named, optionally PUBLIC snapshot of ONE
 *     dashboard (src/api/routes/savedDashboards.ts).
 *
 * They were one hand-copied schema away from drifting, and the drift would be
 * silent in the direction that matters: a public dashboard is replayed into
 * every other operator's browser (and into the unauthenticated Dash wallboard),
 * so the surface that accepts a wider blob is the one that decides what the
 * other has to render. Hence the caps live here too.

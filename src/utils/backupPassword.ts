/**
 * src/utils/backupPassword.ts — strength floor for the optional encrypted-backup
 * passphrase.
 *
 * Server Settings → Maintenance lets an operator encrypt a database backup with
 * a passphrase that scrypt-derives the AES-256-GCM key. The route previously read
 * `req.body?.password || null` with no validation, so an empty/1-char passphrase
 * was accepted — making the "encrypted" backup trivially brute-forceable and
 * defeating the point of encrypting it. This adds a minimum length + a light
 * variety floor (catches "aaaaaaaaaaaa" / "111111111111"-style passphrases).
 *
 * Backup is the only path that validates: on RESTORE you must accept whatever
 * passphrase encrypted an existing file, so restore stays unvalidated.
 *
 * See the 2026-06-03 security review, finding M5.

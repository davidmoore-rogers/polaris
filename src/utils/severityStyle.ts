/**
 * The colour a `down` monitor state is DRAWN in — one entry per severity,
 * mirrored by `DOWN_SEV_COLOR` in public/js/chart-severity.js.
 *
 * Down is not inherently red. Red is what `critical` looks like, and critical
 * happens to be the default severity of every down automation Polaris seeds. An
 * operator who says an outage on this device class is only worth a `warning`
 * has said something about how it should read, and painting it in the same red
 * as a critical outage overrides that on every surface at once.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT the `SEVERITY_HEX` values above. Those colour a whole alert
 * — an email's severity bar, a Teams card — where nothing else competes. These
 * land on the response-time chart and the Last-30-min strip, which already
 * spend amber on a below-threshold miss (#ffc107), blue on a recovering probe
 * (#0288d1) and grey on a dependency-explained one (#9aa0a6). Each value here
 * is pulled deliberately deeper than its neighbour in that vocabulary so the
 * two stay tellable apart:
 *
 *   critical      #d32f2f  the red every surface already used — unchanged, so
 *                          a default install looks exactly as it did
 *   serious       #e65100  deep orange, well clear of the miss amber
 *   warning       #f9a825  the operator's "yellow", a shade under #ffc107
 *   informational #1565c0  darker than the recovering blue
 *   notice        #546e7a  darker than the dependency grey
 *
 * The warning/amber pair is the closest of the four and it is a real limit
 * rather than a bug: a warning-severity outage and the misses that built it are
 * two shades of one yellow. They stay separable by shape and by tooltip — the
 * misses are the climb, the down is the verdict — and by the pill, which names
 * the state outright. An unrecognized severity falls back to the red, because
 * that is what Down has always been.

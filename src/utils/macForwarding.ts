/**
 * src/utils/macForwarding.ts
 *
 * Decoding for the switch MAC forwarding database (the CAM table), from
 * Q-BRIDGE-MIB `dot1qTpFdbTable` (RFC 4363) and BRIDGE-MIB `dot1dTpFdbTable`
 * (RFC 4188).
 *
 * Two things make this fiddly enough to be worth isolating and testing:
 *
 *   1. **The MAC is in the OID index, not a column.** Both tables index by the
 *      address itself as six decimal sub-identifiers — `dot1qTpFdbTable` after
 *      a leading FDB id, `dot1dTpFdbTable` alone. There is no "macAddress"
 *      column to read.
 *   2. **The port value is a dot1dBasePort, not an ifIndex.** Unlike PoE, the
 *      join is defined by the MIB (`dot1dBasePortIfIndex`), so it is reliable —
 *      but it must actually be performed, and forgetting it silently attributes
 *      every MAC to the wrong interface.
 *
 * Dependency-free so the whole decision table unit-tests directly.

 * with a whole network behind it, and picking any single MAC from that set

 *
 * Known limits, all of which push toward under-claiming rather than over-:
 *
 *   - An IP phone with a PC daisy-chained behind it puts two MACs on one access
 *     port, so that port yields nothing. Correct: the port is not one device.
 *   - A port facing a switch that currently has one client behind it looks
 *     identical to an access port. Distinguishing them needs the far end's own
 *     table (bidirectional confirmation), which is a follow-on once there is
 *     real fleet data to validate against.
 *   - A stale entry that has not aged out can name a device that has moved.
 *     The FDB is refreshed wholesale each scrape, so this self-corrects.
 *
 * `self` and `mgmt` rows are excluded: the former is the bridge's own address,

/**
 * src/utils/fortiswitchTrunkMap.ts
 *
 * Decoding for the FortiSwitch trunk→physical-port map published as a single
 * OctetString at `1.3.6.1.4.1.12356.106.3.1.0` (`fsTrunkMember.0`).
 *
 * Observed on FortiSwitchOS 7.6.6 (FS-124E-FPOE):
 *
 *   8EF5920000001-0: port23 ::8EPTQ21000003-0: port27 ::GT61FTK21000002: port24 ::
 *
 * Each entry is `<trunk name>: <local physical port>`, separated by `::`. This
 * is the switch stating its own adjacencies. The trunk names the switch
 * auto-creates are built from the SERIAL NUMBER of the device at the far end,
 * so it names those peers directly instead of leaving them to be inferred.
 *
 * The scalar carries the LAGs an operator configured by hand in the same
 * string, and those are named for whatever is plugged into them:
 *
 *   _FlInK1_ICL0_: port51 ::Cohesity Node 2: port2 ::PLPCORTSC2: port9 ::
 *
 * So a trunk name is a member/parent edge always and a peer identity only
 * sometimes — see `isPeerSerialTail` for the shape test that separates them.
 *
 * ── Why the names look mangled ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The trunk name is the peer's serial, suffixed `-0` for a switch, then
 * **left-truncated to 15 characters**. That single rule explains what looks
 * like two different conventions:
 *
 *   S108EF5920000001 + "-0" = 18 chars → rightmost 15 → 8EF5920000001-0
 *   FGT61FTK21000002        = 16 chars → rightmost 15 → GT61FTK21000002
 *
 * A switch appears to lose three leading characters and a FortiGate only one,
 * purely because the `-0` consumes two of the fifteen.
 *
 * ── Consequence for matching ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Do NOT try to reconstruct the serial: that would hard-code the 15-char cap
 * and break the day a firmware release changes it. Match by SUFFIX instead —
 * strip any trailing `-<n>`, then find the asset whose serial ENDS WITH what
 * remains. That is correct under any cap, and it degrades safely: a tail short
 * enough to match two devices resolves to nothing rather than to a guess.

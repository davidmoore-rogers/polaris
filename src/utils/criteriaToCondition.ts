/**
 * src/utils/criteriaToCondition.ts
 *
 * Folds a flat `TagCriteria` blob forward into a nested condition tree, so a
 * contact whose device filter was written by the old builder opens in the new
 * one with its rules intact — the `normalizeRuleToV2` pattern, one shape
 * forward, every reader normalizing through it.
 *
 * The two vocabularies line up because the tree's DEVICE_FILTER field set was
 * widened to cover what criteria could say (osVersion / department / location /
 * fortigate, plus the wildcard operator). The ONE thing it can't express is
 * `integration` ("discovered by integration X"), which the address-book UI never
 * offered — only an API caller could have written it. That is reported rather
 * than dropped: a caller that can't convert every rule keeps the flat blob
 * instead of silently narrowing who a contact is responsible for.
 *
 * Semantics being preserved:
 *   - criteria rules are ANDed          → root group `and`
 *   - values WITHIN a rule are ORed     → an `or` subgroup (one leaf if single)
 *   - exact → equals, contains → contains, pattern → matches (wildcard)
 *   - subnet cidrs are ORed             → `inCidr` leaves
 *
 * Pure, dependency-free (its own minimal input shape, no service import) so it
 * can be unit-tested against both vocabularies without a DB.

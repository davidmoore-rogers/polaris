/**
 * src/utils/configSecretFields.ts — which JSON keys hold secrets.
 *
 * Consumed by the Prisma extension in src/db.ts, which seals these fields on
 * write and opens them on read for the four secret-bearing JSON columns:
 * Credential.config, Integration.config, NotificationChannel.config, and
 * Setting.value (LDAP bind password, OIDC client secret, agent signing key,
 * event-archive SFTP password, the scheduled-backup passphrase).
 *
 * ── Why a name union rather than per-type lists ────────────────────────────────
 * Each of those services already owns a per-type secret-field list for MASKING
 * (credentialService's SECRET_FIELDS_BY_TYPE, integrations' stripSecret, the
 * `secret: true` flags in CHANNEL_TYPE_META). Encryption deliberately does NOT
 * reuse them, for two reasons:
 *
 *   1. Coupling. db.ts is the lowest layer in the graph; importing three
 *      services' vocabularies into it would invert the dependency direction and
 *      drag the notification type catalogue into every process.
 *   2. Failure direction. A per-type list that MISSES a field stores a real
 *      secret in plaintext, silently. A name union that includes a field which
 *      happens not to be secret for some type merely encrypts a harmless value.
 *      Over-sealing is a non-event; under-sealing is the bug being fixed.
 *
 * So: any string leaf whose KEY is in this set gets sealed, wherever it appears
 * in the JSON (the walk is recursive because Integration.config nests secrets
 * inside per-class blocks, and Setting.value shapes vary per key).
 *
 * ── Adding a field ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * When you add a config field that holds a secret, add its key here IN THE SAME
 * CHANGE as the masking entry. Sealing is idempotent and openValue passes
 * plaintext through, so adding a name is safe on an existing install: new writes
 * seal, and the backfillSecretEncryption job seals what is already stored.

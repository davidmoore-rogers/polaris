/**
 * src/utils/alertSeverity.ts — how ALERT severities compare.
 *
 * The vocabulary is the automation ladder (`notice` → `informational` →
 * `warning` → `serious` → `critical`) plus the two legacy audit-event levels
 * that pre-redesign Notification rows still carry (`info` ranks with
 * informational, `error` with critical). An unrecognized value ranks 0 rather
 * than throwing — a severity Polaris has never heard of must not be able to
 * out-rank a critical, nor to crash a list render.
 *
 * Pure, and deliberately here rather than in a service: three callers already
 * need it — the NOC feeds' severity-first sort, the assets list's active-alert
 * indicator, and the asset slide-over's Alerts tab — and a rank map copied per
 * consumer is how one of them ends up disagreeing about what `serious` means.
 * The COLOUR counterpart is utils/severityStyle.ts (off-browser surfaces) and
 * the `.badge-level-*` / `--color-sev-*` tokens in styles.css (in-browser).

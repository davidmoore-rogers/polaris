 * Exists because map-region LEVELS are derived from polygon nesting — a region
 * drawn around several smaller regions is a division — and `geo.ts` only knows
 * how to test a POINT against a ring. This module answers "does ring A contain
 * ring B?", which nothing in Polaris could answer before.
 *
 * Deliberately a sibling of `geo.ts` rather than an extension of it: that file
 * is a 112-line leaf imported by the discovery hot path (`syncDhcpSubnets`,
 * `mapRegionService.computeMembership`), and it should stay that way. This
 * module imports `LatLng` + `pointInPolygon` from it and adds nothing to it.
 *
 * Coordinates are [latitude, longitude] throughout, matching `geo.ts`. Every
 * "area" here is in square degrees — meaningless as a measurement, and used
 * ONLY to compare two rings against each other (which ring is bigger, are two
 * rings the same size). Never surface it to an operator.
 *
 * Does NOT handle polygons crossing the antimeridian, the same documented
 * limitation `pointInPolygon` carries.

 *
 * POWER-ETHERNET-MIB (RFC 3621) decoding for the PoE half of the interfaces
 * stream: what a `pethPsePortTable` row means, and which interface it belongs
 * to.
 *
 * Why the second half is hard: the table is `INDEX { pethPsePortGroupIndex,
 * pethPsePortIndex }` and **RFC 3621 provides no join back to ifIndex**.
 * BRIDGE-MIB hands you `dot1dBasePortIfIndex` for exactly this; POWER-ETHERNET
 * hands you nothing, so correlating a PoE row to a port name is inference and
 * is treated as such here — an unresolvable row is dropped, never guessed onto
 * a neighbouring interface.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free (no Prisma, no SNMP types) so the whole decision table
 * unit-tests directly, matching utils/hardwareSensors.ts.

 * second is evidence about the device: a switch with no PSE answers, an
 * unreachable one does not. Collapsing both into "empty" is what let a single
 * timed-out walk write the 30-minute absent-cache on a healthy PoE switch,
 * blanking `poeStatus` on every sample it wrote for half an hour — long enough
 * for a live PoE alert to be retired as a vanished dimension and re-raised as a
 * new one, i.e. a duplicate alert email caused entirely by one dropped packet.
 *
 * Only `"no-pse"` may be cached. `"unreadable"` must be retried next tick.
 *
 * The negative cache keeps its point, because the shape that matters is the
 * common one: a device with no PSE ANSWERS the subtree walk (net-snmp feeds
 * back an out-of-prefix OID or an error varbind, both of which `snmpWalk`
 * filters, then resolves) and is cached exactly as before. A rejection means
 * the host stopped answering mid-scrape, in which case the rest of the
 * collector is failing too. The cost of not caching those is two extra walks
 * per tick on a device that is already unreachable — paid deliberately, so
 * that a transient failure cannot masquerade as a fact about the hardware for
 * the next half hour.

 * `port5`; `GigabitEthernet1/0/7` likewise ends in the front-panel number.
 * Accepted only when exactly ONE interface has that trailing number — an
 * ambiguous match (a stacked switch with `1/0/5` and `2/0/5`) is not resolved
 * by guessing.
 *
 * A second strategy — treating the PoE port index as an ifIndex — was
 * deliberately REMOVED. That is the same `index == ifIndex` equivalence the
 * FortiSwitch sensor-name annotation was reverted for (commit 97e54fd2): it
 * holds often enough to look right and fails silently the rest of the time,
 * and a PoE status attached to the wrong port is worse than none — it alerts
 * on a healthy port while staying silent on the faulted one. Port NUMBERING,
 * by contrast, is a front-panel convention the vendor maintains deliberately,
 * which is a weaker claim about the OID tree and a stronger one about reality.
 *
 * Anything unresolved is omitted from the result rather than attached to a
 * best-guess interface: a PoE status stamped on the wrong port is worse than
 * no PoE status, because it would alert on a port that is fine and stay silent
 * on the one that is not.

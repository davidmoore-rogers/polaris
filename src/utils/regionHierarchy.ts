/**
 * src/utils/regionHierarchy.ts
 *
 * Derives the map-region containment FOREST and a level per region from polygon
 * nesting alone. Pure, no DB, no I/O.
 *
 * Why derived rather than a flag an operator sets: a region "is" a division
 * because it contains other regions, so a stored level is a second source of
 * truth that a restore, a backup import or a hand-edited Setting can silently
 * desynchronize — and the drift would be invisible, because nothing would
 * recompute to compare.
 *
 * Input is `{id, polygon}` only — no names, no colors. The presenter joins those
 * back on. That keeps this file trivially testable and stops it drifting into a
 * service.
 *
 * ── depth vs level: BOTH are here, and they are not interchangeable ──────────
 *
 * `depth` counts from the outermost ring inward (0 = top-level) and is always
 * gap-free. `level` counts from the leaves outward (1 = a region containing
 * nothing) and CAN have gaps: a parent holding one bare leaf and one 3-deep
 * chain is L4, with children at L1 and L3 and no L2 anywhere beneath it.
 *
 * So `level` is what an operator reads — it is their mental model, and it is
 * what the region tree displays — while `depth` / `ancestorIds` is what code
 * should route on. **Never compute a routing target with `level + 1`
 * arithmetic**: on an uneven tree that lands on a level that does not exist and
 * silently reaches nobody. Walk `ancestorIds` instead, which is contiguous by
 * construction.

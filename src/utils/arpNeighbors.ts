/**
 * Pure decoding of a device's IP neighbour cache out of IP-MIB SNMP walks.
 *
 * Two generations of the same table, both bundled in `std:ip`:
 *
 *   ipNetToPhysicalTable  1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1  (RFC 4293 — current)
 *     INDEX { ifIndex, addressType, address }   — IPv4 ARP *and* IPv6 NDP
 *   ipNetToMediaTable     1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1  (RFC 1213 — deprecated)
 *     INDEX { ifIndex, netAddress }             — IPv4 only
 *
 * Prefer the first, fall back to the second: the same shape as the
 * dot1qTpFdbTable -> dot1dTpFdbTable fallback in macForwarding.ts, and for the
 * same reason — the modern table is not universally implemented.
 *
 * The ADDRESS is decoded from the OID index in both cases. On the modern table
 * that is the only place it exists (the index objects are not-accessible, so
 * walking them answers nothing); on the legacy table the columns are readable
 * too, but decoding the index works for both and avoids a second walk whose
 * rows would have to be re-joined.
 *
 * No I/O — the caller does the walking. See collectArpNeighborsSnmp.

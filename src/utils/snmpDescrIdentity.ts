/**
 * src/utils/snmpDescrIdentity.ts
 *
 * Read a vendor's OWN documented sysDescr format.
 *
 * `utils/snmpIdentity.ts` deliberately refused to derive a model from
 * sysDescr, and the reason it gave is still right: that object is free text,
 * so a cross-vendor regex ("the token after the vendor word is the model") is
 * the kind of inference that is correct often enough to look correct and
 * silently wrong the rest of the time.
 *
 * This file is the narrow version of that job, and the difference is where the
 * knowledge comes from. Some vendors publish a FIXED, delimited sysDescr whose
 * fields are positional by specification — an AXIS camera answers
 *
 *   `; AXIS M2036-LE; Bullet Camera; 10.12.114; Oct 03 2022 14:20; 7EC.1; 1`
 *
 * which is model, product type, firmware, build date and hardware id in that
 * order, on every AXIS device. Reading that is not a guess; it is parsing a
 * format. So the rule mirrors the enterprise table next door: **a vendor is in
 * here only when its layout is known, and a string that does not match the
 * layout yields nothing rather than a partial guess.**
 *
 * Three consequences worth stating:
 *
 *  - **Every parser ANCHORS on the vendor token, it does not count from the
 *    left.** AXIS puts an operator-settable free-text name in field 1 — empty
 *    on a factory-fresh camera, the device's name once someone sets it — so
 *    "field 3 is the firmware" is wrong on exactly the devices an operator has
 *    already touched. Anchoring on `AXIS <model>` and walking right is stable
 *    across both.
 *  - **A field is claimed only when it is SHAPED like what it should be.** The
 *    firmware slot has to look like a version, or `osVersion` stays empty. A
 *    vendor that reorders its own format across a firmware generation then
 *    yields less detail, never wrong detail.
 *  - **Only fields Polaris can store are parsed.** The build date and the
 *    hardware id (`7EC.1`) are real and identify a board revision, but there
 *    is no Asset column for either and `AssetPhysicalEntity` is ENTITY-MIB's,
 *    populated by a different walk. Parsing them here would produce a value
 *    whose only consumer is this comment.

/**
 * How the reading reaches the Asset row, and why nothing here decides it.
 *
 * This file used to own that decision: `decideDescrAdoption` compared the
 * parse against the stored columns and returned the fields to write. It was
 * retired when the reading became a real `AssetSource` row (`snmp-sysdescr`),
 * because the decision it was making is the one `utils/assetProjection.ts`
 * already makes for every other source — by PRIORITY, across all of them at
 * once. Two places answering "may this overwrite that?" is how a fleet ends
 * up with two writers trading values every cycle.
 *
 * The priority list ranks this source directly above `fortigate-endpoint`:
 * a device's own SNMP self-report beats a gate's DHCP fingerprint (which
 * answers "ip camera"), and loses to an agent, Arc, vCenter or MDM reading
 * the running system from inside it.
 *
 * What survives here is the cheap gate below — the question the monitor path
 * asks before doing any I/O at all.

/**
 * Did the device's answer change since we last recorded it?
 *
 * The comparison the monitor path gates on, and it deliberately compares two
 * RECORDINGS rather than a recording against the Asset columns. A device
 * whose model a higher-priority source legitimately owns (an in-guest agent,
 * Arc, Intune) disagrees with those columns on every single pass — so gating
 * on the columns would re-write and re-project forever to arrive at the same
 * answer. Gating on "what the device said last time" converges whoever wins.
 *
 * Field-wise rather than JSON-wise: key order and absent-vs-null are not
 * changes, and a stringify comparison would call them one.

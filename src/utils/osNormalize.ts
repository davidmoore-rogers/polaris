/**

 *
 * Correct the Windows product name every discovery source gets wrong, and
 * label the build with the release operators actually speak in ("23H2").
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR: Microsoft never updated
 * `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProductName` when Windows
 * 11 shipped. It still reads "Windows 10 Pro" on every Windows 11 client. That
 * key is what WMI's `Win32_OperatingSystem.Caption`, `systeminfo`, and most
 * inventory agents read — so it is NOT one broken integration, it is all of
 * them at once:
 *
 *   - AD          `operatingSystem`        → "Windows 10 Pro"
 *   - Entra/Intune `operatingSystem`       → "Windows" (no edition at all)
 *   - Polaris Agent (gopsutil host.Info)   → Platform from the same key
 *   - fortigate-endpoint OS fingerprint    → coarse, same family confusion
 *
 * The BUILD number, meanwhile, is always right, because it comes from
 * `CurrentBuild`/`CurrentBuildNumber` rather than the frozen display string.
 * So the build is the authority and the name is derived from it.
 *
 * TWO MECHANISMS, DELIBERATELY SEPARATE:
 *
 *   1. FAMILY (Windows 10 vs 11) comes from a THRESHOLD — build >= 22000.
 *      A threshold never goes stale, so a Windows build released after this
 *      code was written still gets the right family.
 *   2. RELEASE LABEL ("23H2") comes from a TABLE, which does go stale. An
 *      unknown build therefore keeps its raw osVersion untouched rather than
 *      being guessed at — the family fix still lands, only the pretty label
 *      is skipped.
 *
 * SERVER IS EXCLUDED ENTIRELY. Server's ProductName is correct already
 * ("Windows Server 2022 Standard"), and build 26100 is BOTH Windows 11 24H2
 * and Windows Server 2025 — so the threshold would happily relabel a 2025
 * server as "Windows 11". Any os string containing "server" is left alone.
 *
 * Applied at WRITE time in two places (both call this one function):
 *   - projectAssetFromSources (utils/assetProjection.ts) — so the projected
 *     pair, projectionDriftService's comparison, and conflict proposals all
 *     agree. Normalizing only on the way to the DB would make drift detection
 *     report a permanent mismatch between "Windows 10 Pro" and the stored
 *     "Windows 11 Pro", every cycle, forever.
 *   - the Asset write hooks in db.ts — the catch-all for the legacy inline
 *     writers (discoveryEngine's fortigate-endpoint path, the agents
 *     system-info route, conflictResolutionService, the assets PUT route).
 *
 * Storing the corrected value rather than transforming at render is what makes
 * the rest of the product agree: the Assets table's OS/Firmware filter + sort,
 * CSV/PDF export, `os`/`osVersion` tag-assignment criteria, maintenance-window
 * criteria, and automation scope conditions all read the stored columns. An
 * "os contains Windows 11" rule is only true if the column says so.

/**
 * src/utils/cableMembers.ts
 *
 * Pairing decision for the Device Map's inter-switch physical-member
 * expansion: given each side's resolved member ports, how many cable lines
 * should be drawn and which port sits on each end.
 *
 * Pure — the caller (topologyGraphService) resolves the member lists from
 * LLDP local ports and managed-switch CMDB trunk membership, stamps each
 * member's physical/link-state facts, and renders whatever this returns.
 *
 * Two rules, both learned from the same prod symptom (a 1-cable link between
 * two FortiSwitches drawn as two parallel lines that named the SAME far-end
 * port on both):
 *
 *   1. A physical port terminates exactly ONE cable, so a lone physical
 *      member can never be the far end of two lines. The previous behaviour
 *      padded the short side by repeating its only member across
 *      max(a, b) lines — which is precisely how one real cable rendered as
 *      two whenever the far switch's evidence claimed an extra member. An
 *      AGGREGATE name is still repeated: it labels the whole bundle, and a
 *      side whose CMDB trunk membership hasn't been scraped degrades to that
 *      name rather than to its members.
 *
 *   2. Link state breaks ties, it does not filter. A member the device
 *      reports as anything but `up` can't be carrying a cable right now, so
 *      it loses to a live sibling — but a side that resolved exactly one
 *      member keeps it whatever its state, since a genuinely down link
 *      should render (greyed, via the edge tooltip's operStatus) rather than
 *      disappear from the map. A member with NO reading is kept: unknown is
 *      not down.

/**
 * Load the REAL `buildOverlay` out of public/js/app.js into a test's globals.
 *
 * `buildOverlay` is the shared stacked-modal builder (app.js loads on every
 * page). A DOM test that needs it cannot eval the whole of app.js — that file
 * boots the app shell — and stubbing it would make the assertions about overlay
 * structure and z-index rungs vacuous, since the stub would be the thing under
 * test. So slice the one function out and eval that.
 *
 * The slice is brace-balanced rather than line-counted, so it survives edits to
 * the function body; it throws loudly if the function is renamed or moved, which
 * is the signal a caller wants rather than a silently absent global.

/**
 * tests/unit/infraDhcpBinding.test.ts — the lease-vs-binding decisions behind
 * Fortinet-infra reservation rows (src/utils/infraDhcpBinding.ts).
 *
 * The bug these exist to prevent: Phase 3a/3b create a fortiswitch/fortinap
 * reservation for every managed switch/AP, sometimes from an address read out of
 * the gate's DHCP lease table, and Phase 5 had no branch for those source types
 * — so a leased address rendered as an authoritative reservation with no Reserve
 * action while the FortiGate reported "Not Reserved".
 *
 * Four properties are pinned hardest, because each one is a way the feature could
 * silently do damage rather than merely misbehave:
 *   - `expiresAt` is NEVER staged (it would hand these rows to expireReservations
 *     and churn a live AP through expired/re-created cycles),
 *   - the MAC is fill-only and comes from the lease entry (a wrong MAC yields a
 *     device-side binding that looks right everywhere and never binds),
 *   - only an explicit "lease" is claimable — NULL means unobserved, not free,
 *   - a reservation for THIS device isn't a conflict with this device (otherwise
 *     the first reserved AP produces a conflict card per cycle).

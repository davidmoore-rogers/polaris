/**
 * tests/unit/recoveryConfirmation.test.ts
 *
 * The RECOVERY CONFIRMATION RUN (business rule 36): a `monitor status is down`
 * automation already decides how many MISSED polls make a device down, and its
 * reset now decides how many RECEIVED polls make it up again.
 *
 * Three pure pieces carry it, and this file covers the two that translate an
 * automation's stored reset into a poll count plus the engine-side consequence.
 * The state machine itself is pinned in monitorStatusStateMachine.test.ts and
 * the strip's replay of it in assetIntermittencyBar.test.ts.
 *
 *   downRecoverySustainSec  — is this reset a recovery count at all?
 *   recoveryPollsFor        — seconds → polls at the asset's own cadence
 *   recoveredMeets          — when the ALERT ends, given the machine already
 *                             served the hold

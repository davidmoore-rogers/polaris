/**
 * tests/integration/subnetSupersedeDeprecated.test.ts
 *
 * A dead subnet must not squat on its CIDR (business rule 41), driven through
 * the REAL Phase 1 of syncDhcpSubnets against a real database — because the
 * bug this covers lived entirely in the wiring, not in the decision.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG. Rule 41 shipped with the chassis comparison inside Phase 1's
 * `if (existing)` branch, and `existing` comes from `subnetByCidr`, which
 * EXCLUDES deprecated rows. So for a subnet that was already deprecated — every
 * subnet on an install that had a gate replaced before the feature existed —
 * the comparison never ran at all: the lookup missed, the create path was
 * reached, and the committed-state overlap check refused it on the dead row.
 * The operator saw the same "skipped subnet" event as before, on a build that
 * supposedly fixed it, and the only remedy was an API call with no UI behind
 * it. Unit tests could not catch that: `classifyDeprecatedSupersede` was right,
 * it just wasn't reachable.
 *
 * The other half is what must NOT happen. An operator who deprecates a subnet
 * that its own gate still serves gets it re-reported on every cycle, and
 * archiving there would silently hand a retired range back as active.

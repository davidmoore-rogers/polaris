/**
 * tests/integration/backupRestore.test.ts
 *
 * The backup/restore round trip — the one path whose failure is unrecoverable,
 * and the one that had zero coverage before 2026-08. Grepping the suite for
 * `database/backup`, `database/restore` or `pg_dump` returned nothing, which is
 * how the backup path came to be simultaneously (a) event-loop-blocking and
 * memory-bound and (b) not Timescale-aware, without anything flagging either.
 *
 * What this asserts, in order of consequence:
 *   1. A backup RESTORES. A row created before the backup, deleted after it, is
 *      present again once the restore completes. Nothing else in the suite
 *      proves the file is usable rather than merely produced.
 *   2. The Timescale gates run when the extension is installed. Skipping
 *      timescaledb_pre_restore()/post_restore() is what made the restore
 *      unreliable in the first place, so their absence must be a test failure,
 *      not a silent behaviour change.
 *   3. The database is not left in restoring mode after a FAILED restore. That
 *      failure mode is worse than the failed restore itself — normal hypertable
 *      writes start rejecting.
 *   4. The encrypted variant round-trips, and a wrong passphrase is a clean 400.
 *   5. Queries work again after a restore. `--clean --if-exists` drops and
 *      recreates every table, so a connection opened beforehand holds cached
 *      relation OIDs that no longer exist and fails with
 *      `XX000 could not open relation with OID <n>`. restoreBackup recycles the
 *      pool in a finally for exactly this reason; asserting a query straight
 *      after the restore is what proves it.
 *
 * Skips cleanly when DATABASE_URL is unreachable (see _helpers.ts) OR when the
 * PostgreSQL client tools are not on PATH — the app container ships them, a bare
 * dev host often does not.
